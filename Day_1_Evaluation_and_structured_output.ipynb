Infrastructure:**\n\n*   **TPUv4 Accelerators:** Training is performed on multiple 4096-chip pods of Google's TPUv4 accelerators.\n*   **Distributed Training:** These accelerators are distributed across multiple datacenters.\n\n**3. Model Architecture:**\n\n*   **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformer:** Gemini 1.5 Pro is based on a sparse MoE Transformer architecture. This allows the model to have a large number of parameters while only activating a subset for any given input.\n\n**4.

            "text/markdown": "Certainly! Here’s a summary of the **training process** used for Gemini 1.5 Pro, based on the technical report:\n\n---\n\n## **Training Process of Gemini 1.5 Pro**\n\n### **1. Model Architecture**\n- **Gemini 1.5 Pro** is a **sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) Transformer-based model**.\n- It builds on the Gemini 1.0 architecture, with significant changes to support extremely long context windows (up to 10 million tokens) and efficient multimodal processing (text, images, audio, video).\n\n### **2. Training Infrastructure**\n- **Hardware:** Training was performed on multiple 4096-chip pods of Google’s TPUv4 accelerators, distributed across several datacenters.\n- **Software:** The model was trained using JAX and ML Pathways, which allow for large-scale, efficient, and parallelized training.\n\n### **3. Training Data**\n- **Pre-training Dataset:** Gemini 1.5 Pro was trained on a large, diverse, and multimodal dataset, including:\n  - Web documents\n  - Code\n  - Images\n  - Audio\n  - Video\n  - Multilingual data\n- The dataset covers a wide range of domains and modalities to enable the model’s broad capabilities.\n\n### **4. Training Phases**\n#### **A. Pre-training**\n- The model is trained from random initialization on the large multimodal and multilingual dataset.\n- The objective is next-token prediction (language modeling), which is standard for large language models.\n\n#### **B. Instruction Tuning (Fine-tuning)**\n- After pre-training, Gemini 1.5 Pro undergoes **instruction tuning**:\n  - The model is fine-tuned on a curated set of multimodal data containing paired instructions and desired responses.\n  - Further tuning is performed using **human preference data** (i.e., reinforcement learning from human feedback, RLHF) to improve helpfulness, safety, and alignment with user intent.\n\n### **5. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Details**\n- MoE models use a learned routing function to direct each input to a subset of the model’s parameters (the “experts”).\n- This allows the model to scale up the total parameter count while keeping the number of active parameters per input constant, making training and inference more efficient.\n\n### **6. Long-Context Support**\n- Gemini 1.5 Pro incorporates architectural innovations and system-level optimizations to support context windows up to 10 million tokens.\n- This enables the model to process entire codebases, long books, hours of video/audio, and large collections of documents in a single pass.\n\n### **7. Efficiency**\n- Despite its increased capabilities, Gemini 1.5 Pro is **more efficient to train and serve** than previous models (e.g., Gemini 1.0 Ultra), thanks to the MoE architecture and infrastructure improvements.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nGemini 1.5 Pro is trained in two main phases (pre-training and instruction tuning) on a massive, diverse, and multimodal dataset, using a sparse MoE Transformer architecture and large-scale TPU infrastructure. The process is designed for efficiency, scalability, and the ability to handle extremely long contexts across multiple modalities.\n\nIf you want more technical details (e.g., about optimization, data curation, or specific training tricks), let me know!"

It remains a summary (shorter than an original technical report section), not a full copy or overly wordy paraphrase.\n- This is the highest rating per rubric guidance, as the summary is instruction-following, concise, grounded, and fluent."

That's kind of like training a big computer brain (the language model).\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1.  **Show the puppy lots of examples:** You show the puppy lots of pictures, videos, and words. For example, you show it pictures of cats and say \"cat,\" pictures of dogs and say \"dog,\" and so on. The computer brain also sees lots of examples of text, images, and videos.\n\n2.  **Tell the puppy what's right and wrong:** When the puppy does something right, you give it a treat and say \"Good dog!\" When it does something wrong, you say \"No!\" or correct it. The computer brain has a special program that tells it when it's doing a good job (like predicting the next word in a sentence correctly) and when it's making a mistake.\n\n3.  **The puppy learns and gets better:** The puppy starts to learn which actions get it treats and which ones don't. It starts to understand what \"sit\" means and what \"fetch\" means. The computer brain also learns from its mistakes and gets better at understanding language, images, and videos.\n\n4.  **Practice, practice, practice:** You keep showing the puppy examples and giving it feedback until it's really good at understanding and doing tricks. The computer brain also needs lots and lots of practice to become really good at understanding and generating language.\n\nSo, training a language model is like teaching a puppy, but instead of treats, the computer brain gets special signals that help it learn and get better at understanding the world.\n-----"

This helps the robot learn about words, pictures, sounds, and how they all fit together.\n\n2. **Learning by Example:**  \nWhen the robot reads or watches something, it tries to guess what comes next. For example, if it reads “The cat sat on the ___,” it tries to guess “mat.” If it gets it right, it gets a little reward. If it gets it wrong, it tries again and learns from its mistake.\n\n3. **Getting Better with Practice:**  \nThe robot does this guessing game millions and millions of times! Each time, it gets a little bit better at understanding and remembering things.\n\n4. **Special Lessons:**  \nAfter lots of practice, the robot gets special lessons where people give it instructions and show it the best answers. This helps the robot learn how to be helpful, safe, and polite when talking to people.\n\n5. **Learning to Listen to Many Things at Once:**  \nThis robot is extra special because it can remember really long stories, lots of pictures, and even hours of video or sound all at once! It learns how to pay attention to the most important parts, just like when you listen to a long story and remember the best parts.\n\n---\n\n**So, training the robot is like teaching it by showing it lots of examples, letting it practice, and giving it special lessons so it can help you with anything you ask!**\n-----"

The use of lists and bolded section names improve clarity.\n- Sentences are simple, logical, and easy to follow for the intended audience.\n\nSTEP 2: Score based on the rubric.\n\n- The summary follows the instructions well (ELI5 format).\n- It is grounded in the original information (about model training).\n- It is concise, considering the audience and context constraint.\n- It is fluent, accessible, and well-structured.\n\n**Score: 5 (Very good)**\n\nThis response meets all the requirements of the task as defined by the criteria.\n-----"

        "### LLM limitations\n",
        "\n",
        "LLMs are known to have problems on certain tasks, and these challenges still persist when using LLMs as evaluators. For example, LLMs can struggle to count the number of characters in a word (this is a numerical problem, not a language problem), so an LLM evaluator will not be able to accurately evaluate this type of task. There are solutions available in some cases, such as connecting tools to handle problems unsuitable to a language model, but it's important that you understand possible limitations and include human evaluators to calibrate your evaluation system and determine a baseline.\n",
        "\n",
        "One reason that LLM evaluators work well is that all of the information they need is available in the input context, so the model only needs to attend to that information to produce the result. When customising evaluation prompts, or building your own systems, keep this in mind and ensure that you are not relying on \"internal knowledge\" from the model, or behaviour that might be better provided from a tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Improving confidence\n",
        "\n",
        "One way to improve the confidence of your evaluations is to include a diverse set of evaluators. That is, use the same prompts and outputs, but execute them on different models, like Gemini Flash and Pro, or even across different providers, like Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT and local models like Gemma or Qwen. This follows the same idea used earlier, where repeating trials to gather multiple \"opinions\" helps to [reduce error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), except by using different models the \"opinions\" will be more diverse.\n",
