        "\n",
        "Each **node** in the graph represents an action or step that can be taken. Nodes will make changes to the state in some way through code that you define. These changes can be the result of invoking an LLM, by calling an API, or executing any logic that the node defines.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each **edge** in the graph represents a transition between states, defining the flow of the program. Edge transitions can be fixed, for example if you define a text-only chatbot where output is always displayed to a user, you may always transition from `chatbot -> user`. The transitions can also be conditional, allowing you to add branching (like an `if-else` statement) or looping (like `for` or `while` loops).\n",
